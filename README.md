## How To Get Good Results

[![Good results Demo](/public/good_results.png)](https://blog.tryleap.ai/create-an-ai-headshot-generator-fine-tune-stable-diffusion-with-leap-api/#step-1-gather-your-image-samples-%F0%9F%93%B8)

The image samples used to teach the model what your face looks like are critical. Garbage in = garbage out.

- Enforce close-ups of faces and consider cropping so that the face is centered.
- Enforce images with only one person in the frame.
- Avoid accessories in samples like sunglasses and hats.
- Ensure the face is clearly visible. (For face detection, consider using tools like [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/face_detection_based_transformations?ref=blog.tryleap.ai)).

[![Avoid multiple faces](/public/multiple_faces.png)](https://blog.tryleap.ai/create-an-ai-headshot-generator-fine-tune-stable-diffusion-with-leap-api/#how-to-avoid-multiple-faces-in-results-%E2%9D%8C)

If you get distorted results with multiple faces, repeated subjects, multiple limbs, etc, make sure to follow these steps and minimize the chance of this happening:

- Make sure any samples uploaded are the same 1:1 height / width aspect ratio, for example 512x512, 1024x1024, etc.
- Avoid multiple people in the samples uploaded.
- Add "double torso, totem pole" to the negative prompt when generating.
- Make sure your dimensions when generating are also 1:1 with the same height / width ratios of the samples.
